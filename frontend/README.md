# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

* Runs the app in development mode.
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
* The page will reload when you make changes.
* You may also see lint errors in the console.


### `npm test`

* Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
* Learn more about testing: [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)


### `npm run build`

* Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
* It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
* The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
* Your app is ready to be deployed.

More info: [Deployment Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)


### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!**

* Removes the single build dependency from your project.
* Copies configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
* You gain full control over the build tools and configuration.
* All scripts except `eject` will still work, but they will use your custom configuration.

You should only eject if you need to customize the build configuration beyond what Create React App provides.
